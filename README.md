# ultrasonic_oled_esp32
This Arduino project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 development board with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and display the results on a 0.96-inch OLED display. The HC-SR04 sensor uses sonar to calculate the distance to an object by measuring the time it takes for an ultrasonic pulse to travel to the object and back.

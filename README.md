# ESP32 Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with OLED Display

## Description
This Arduino project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 development board with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and display the results on a 0.96-inch OLED display. The HC-SR04 sensor uses sonar to calculate the distance to an object by measuring the time it takes for an ultrasonic pulse to travel to the object and back.

## Features
- Real-time distance measurement
- OLED display for easy readout
- Arduino IDE compatible

## Components Used
- ESP32 development board
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- 0.96-inch OLED display
- Jumper wires

## Instructions
1. Connect the components as per the provided schematic.
2. Install the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the provided code to the ESP32.
4. Observe the distance measurements displayed on the OLED screen.

## Code
The Arduino sketch (`main.ino`) contains the code for reading the sensor data and displaying it on the OLED display. 

## Credits
This project is inspired by various tutorials and examples available online for using ultrasonic sensors with ESP32 and OLED displays.
